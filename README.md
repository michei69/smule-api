# Smule API

initially hard coded inside of [smule-desktop](https://github.com/michei69/smule-desktop), but i've decided
to release it separately too.

HEAVY WIP --- HOBBY PROJECT

This project is in a _usable_ state, although many things are subject to change. Expect major updates, re-implementations, renames, or breaking changes, without a major version change.

Check some parts of the roadmap, or report issues [here](https://github.com/michei69/smule-api/issues)

###### P.S. Naming schemes, just like in smule-desktop, aren't stabilised. In some places, _arrangements_ will be mentioned as _songs_. This will be fixed in future updates, eventually (maybe :3)
